# Surveillant Spider Robot for Inspection of Mines & Dangerous Terrains  

## Project Overview  
Mining remains one of the most hazardous occupations, exposing workers to risks such as toxic gases, unstable terrains, and extreme environmental conditions. This project presents the **Surveillant Spider Robot**, an advanced bio-inspired robotic system designed for **autonomous inspection and monitoring of mines and dangerous terrains**.  

The robot leverages **spider-like locomotion** for enhanced mobility on irregular surfaces and integrates **real-time environmental sensors** to detect hazardous conditions. The prototype is developed using **3D-printed components** and controlled by an **Arduino UNO**, ensuring a cost-effective and scalable solution for industrial and research applications.  

## Key Features  
- **Bio-Inspired Mobility:** Multi-legged movement mechanism for stable navigation on rough terrains.  
- **Environmental Sensing:** Equipped with gas sensors to detect toxic emissions and monitor air quality.  
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Terrain-adaptive sensors enable autonomous navigation and hazard detection.  
- **Modular and Scalable:** Designed with 3D-printed components for easy modification and enhancements.  
- **Arduino-Based Control:** Efficient and cost-effective microcontroller implementation.
